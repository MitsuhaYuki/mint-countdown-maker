## Core Guidelines

When modifying this program, you MUST:

1. **Reference Documentation First**
  - Always consult `README.md` before making changes
  - Review relevant documents in the `docs/` directory
  - Understand existing architecture and design decisions

2. **Update Documentation After Changes**
  - Synchronize all affected documentation with your code changes
  - Update API references, usage examples, and configuration guides
  - Ensure documentation accurately reflects the current state of the code

3. **Documentation Constraints**
  - **DO NOT** create new documentation files
  - **DO** update existing documentation files only
  - **DO** maintain consistency across all docs

## Workflow

```
Read Docs → Make Changes → Update Existing Docs → Verify Consistency
```

## Key Documents to Reference

- `README.md` - Project overview and quick start
- `docs/` - Detailed technical documentation
- Configuration files and inline code comments

## Before Submitting

- [ ] Code changes are complete
- [ ] Existing documentation is updated
- [ ] No new documentation files were created
